# Cambridge Spark Interview Projects

Here are 3 personal projects I've worked on recently.

## Closest Airport Finder
Provides a user interface with a map allowing users to click on the map and be shown the closest airport to that location, along with the distance coordinates.

## Time String Parser
A python parser for splunk style time strings. It takes a string and returns a datetime object.

## Golf Ball AI Tracker
A **very** rough work in progress project to use AI to identify a moving golf ball in a video feed and track its path.
